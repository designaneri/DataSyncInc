            DataSync Inc. provides you with a platform to know everything you need to know about your customers. The fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry is undergoing a significant transformation in response to the demand for more convenience, the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in customer behavior. Key trends in the FMCG industry that are responding to these changes include Sustainable product and packaging development, solutions that improve the customer experience, and digitization. To deliver a better customer experience and gain a competitive advantage, consumer products companies are pursuing omnichannel sales and e-commerce, in addition to deploying big data, analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. In addition, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 3D printing technology are enabling consumer products companies to improve direct distribution to meet rising customer expectations. To meet these challenges, consumer involvement in product development is essential, with online and physical testing becoming increasingly important in product research. 
          </p>
          <p>In this context, our platform offers incredible advantages (including direct digital contact with potential consumers, direct involvement in the product development process, direct and transparent dialogue and trust building, active customer participation in the process). We put all our energy and expertise into connecting consumer goods manufacturers and consumers through a single, transparent, independent and non-confrontational platform. We invent a new and better future for your business.</p>

              <p>Our platform is considered not only as a technology platform, but also as a service, or what Silicon Valley calls a “product”. The platform is grouped into three (Multi-Channel-Plattformen für die Customer Journey, DataSync Inc. Monitor, Industry applications), main areas.</p>
              <p>The many companies in the FMCG sector are among the most innovative companies of the last generation. A handful of industry leaders are quickly joining their ranks by reinventing their core business around data and digital by engaging the consumer throughout the product creation process, from launch to market.</p>
              <p>
                What distinguishes these companies from the rest is that their technology allows them to act faster, more flexibly and on a larger scale than their competitors. All these functionalities are present in the DataSync Inc. platform.

It is also important that the business and technical teams in the company work closely together and have the decision-making power to act quickly.</p>
             <p>The modular computing configuration of our platform enables FMCG companies to become faster and more innovative, regardless of their size. They are able to experiment, fail, learn and evolve quickly: they can bring their products to market faster than their larger competitors (in weeks instead of months). With this kind of speed and flexibility, product testing (physical and online) can and should become an axis for innovation and growth.</p>
